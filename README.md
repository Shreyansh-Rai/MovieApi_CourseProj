# MovieApi_CourseProj

### Start the Movies backend on port 8080 and use ngrok to expose that port.

### in the front end, go to the api folder and add the ngrok link to allow api calls to be made using that base url. use npm start to run the front end. Very basic front end, changes made to the reviews will just be added to the database (you could check the status of response might add feature to show all reviews if time permits.)
